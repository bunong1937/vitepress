拉康宣称，进展的概念，如同其他的人文主义概念一样，皆是相异于他的教学的：“我丝毫没有在任何事情中表达过进展的概念，这是在该术语可能隐含有某种幸福的解决之道的意义上来说的。”(S17,122)就此而言，拉康基本上是一位悲观主义的思想家，而且他也在弗洛伊德的那些比较阴沉的著作中找到了对于此种悲观主义的支撑，诸如《文明及其不满》(Freud, 1930a)等。这些文本使拉康得以声称“弗洛伊德绝非是一位进步论者”(S7,183).

拉康之所以拒绝进展的概念，是因为其基础在于一种线性单向的时间 (TME)概念，也是因为它隐含了综合的可能性（见：[[dialectic 辩证法]])。连同进展的概念一起，拉康也拒绝了其他的相关概念，诸如心理性欲发展 (DEVELOPMENT)的各个阶段是一种单线次序的概念。

然而，在某种意义上，拉康确实又谈到了进展：精神分析治疗 (TREATMENT)中的进展。就治疗是一种有其开端与结束的过程而言，当这一治疗是运动的而非“被卡住”的时候，我们便可以谈及进展。只要有新的材料呈现出来，治疗便是在进展的。实际上，精神分析治疗可以被描述为“一种朝向真理的进展”(E, 253)。


(progres) Lacan claims that the idea of progress, like other humanist concepts, is alien tohis teaching: 'There is not the slightest idea of progress in anything I articulate, in thesense that this term would imply a happy solution' (S17,122). In this respect, Lacan is abasically pessimistic thinker, and he finds support for such pessimism in the gloomierworks of Freud such as Civilization and its Discontents (Freud, 1930a). These texts allow Lacan to argue that 'Freud was in no way a progressive' (S7,183).

Lacan rejects the idea of progress because it is based on a linear unidirectional conceptof TIME, and also because it implies the possibility of synthesis (see DIALECTIC) Along with the idea of progress, Lacan rejects other related concepts such as that of aunilinear sequence of phases of psychosexual DEVELOPMENT.

There is one sense, however, in which Lacan does speak of progress: the progress inpsychoanalytic TREATMENT. Insofar as treatment is a process which has a beginningand an end, when this treatment is moving and not 'stuck', we may speak of progress. The treatment is progressing as long as new material is emerging. Indeed, psychoanalytictreatment may be described as 'a progress towards truth' (E, 253).
