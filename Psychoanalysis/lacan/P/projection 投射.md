‌‌‌‌　　英：projection; 法：projection; 德：Projektion


‌‌‌‌　　投射是将某种内部的欲望/想法/感受移置到并定位在主体之外的另一主体身上的一种防御机制。例如，一个曾经（或是感到）对其伴侣不忠的人，便可能会通过谴责伴侣的不忠来防御自己的罪疚感。

‌‌‌‌　　虽然弗洛伊德与很多其他的精神分析家皆用“投射”这一术语来描述一种（在不同的程度上）同时存在于精神病与神经症的机制，但是拉康则将“投射”理解为一种纯粹的神经症机制，并且将它清楚地区分于在精神病中出现的那些明显类似的现象（拉康将其称作排除[FORECLOSURE])。投射根植于自我与相似者之间的想象二元关系 (S3,145), 而排除则超越了想象界，反而涉及的是一个没有被兼并在象征界之中的能指。

‌‌‌‌　　拉康同样拒绝把内摄 (NTROJECTION)看作投射的反转，他认为这两个过程被定位在完全不同的层面上。投射是一种想象性机制，而内摄则是一种象征性过程(Ec,655)。


‌‌‌‌　　(projection) Projection is a defence mechanism inwhich an internal desire/thought/feeling is displaced and located outside the subject, in another subject. Forexample a person who has been (or who feels) unfaithful to his partner may defendhimself against feelings of guilt by accusing the partner of being unfaithful.

‌‌‌‌　　Whereas Freud and many other psychoanalysts use the term 'projection'to describe amechanism which is present (to differing degrees) in both psychosis and neurosis, Lacanunderstands the term 'projection'as a purely neurotic mechanism and distinguishes itclearly from the apparently similar phenomenon that occurs in psychosis (which Lacancalls FORECLOSURE). Whereas projection is rooted in the imaginary dual relationshipbetween the ego and the counterpart (S3,145), foreclosure goes beyond the imaginaryand instead involves a signifier which is not incorporated in the symbolic.

‌‌‌‌　　Lacan also rejects the view that INTROJECTION is the inverse of projection, arguingthat these two processes are located on quite different levels. Whereas projection is animaginary mechanism, introjection is a symbolic process (Ec, 655).
