‌‌‌‌　　在其1956一1957年度的研讨班上，拉康区分了“对象缺失”的三种类型，即剥夺、挫折与阉割 (见：[[lack 缺失]])。每一种类型的缺失皆被定位于一个不同的秩序，它们皆由不同的动因所导致，且皆涉及不同的对象。剥夺被定义为一个象征性对象（象征性阳具）在实在界中的缺失。导致此种缺失的动因是想象的父亲。

‌‌‌‌　　剥夺是拉康针对弗洛伊德有关女性阉割与阴茎嫉羡的概念做出的更严格的理论化尝试。根据弗洛伊德的说法，当孩子认识到有些人（女人们）没有阴茎的时候，这一创伤性的时刻便会在男孩与女孩身上产生不同的效果（见：阉割情结[CASTRATION COMPLEX])。男孩会发展出害怕自己的阴茎被割掉的恐惧，而女孩则羡慕男孩对于阴茎的占有，她将阴茎看作一个极其值得欲望的器官。女孩会责备母亲剥夺了她的阴茎，而且会将自己的情感转向父亲，以期待父亲会给她提供一个孩子，作为她所缺失的阴茎的象征性替代 (Freud, 1924d).

‌‌‌‌　　于是，剥夺便指涉的是女性阴茎的缺失，而这显然是一种处在实在界中的缺失。然而，根据定义，“实在界是完满的”（the real is), 就其本身而言，实在界是从不缺失的，因而“剥夺的概念…便隐含着对于实在界中的对象的象征化”(S4,218)。换句话说，当孩子觉察到阴茎（作为一个实在的器官）是“缺位”(absent)的时候，这便仅仅是因为他拥有某种观念，相信阴茎无论如何都应该在那里，而这便把象征界引入了实在界。因而，缺失的便不是实在的器官，因为从生物学上讲，阴道并非没有阴茎就不完整：缺失的是一个象征的对象，即象征的阳具。它在女孩的无意识中能够由一个孩子来替代，这一事实便证实了其象征性的本质。弗洛伊德指出，通过欲望一个孩子来缓和自己的阴茎嫉羡，女孩便会“沿着一条象征性等式的路线一我们可以说一从阴茎滑向孩子”(Freud, 1924d: SE XIX. 178-9)

‌‌‌‌　　弗洛伊德认为小女孩会责备她的母亲剥夺了自己的阴茎。然而，拉康则指出是想象的父亲被当作剥夺的动因。不过，这两种说法未必是不可兼容的。虽然女孩起初可能会怨恨母亲剥夺了自己的阴茎，并且转向父亲以期望他会给自己提供某种象征性替代物，但是当父亲后来未能给她提供自己所欲望的孩子的时候，她又会将自己的怨恨转向父亲。

‌‌‌‌　　弗洛伊德声称，阴茎嫉羡会一直持续至成年期，它既表现于女人想要在性交中享乐阴茎的欲望，又表现于女性想要拥有一个孩子的欲望 (因为父亲未能给她提供一个孩子，女人便转向另一个男人作为替代)。拉康则指出，即便当女人拥有一个孩子的时候，这也并不等于是其剥夺感的终结。无论她拥有多少个孩子，她对阳具的欲望始终都是得不到满足的。从很早的时候开始，孩子便会觉察到母亲的此种基本不满足 (S4,194); 他会认识到母亲的欲望指向了超越母亲与自己关系之外的某种东西一想象的阳具。于是，孩子便会试图通过认同想象的阳具来满足她的欲望。因此，对于母亲的剥夺便是把欲望辩证法第一次引入孩子的生活之中的原因。


‌‌‌‌　　(privation) In his seminar of 1956-7, Lacan distinguishes between three types of 'lack ofobject': privation, frustration and castration (see LACK). Each of these types of lack islocated in a different order, each is brought about by a different kind of agent, and eachinvolves a different kind of object. Privation is defined as a lack in the real of a symbolicobject (the symbolic phallus). The agent who brings about this lack is the imaginaryfather.

‌‌‌‌　　Privation is Lacan's attempt to theorise more rigorously Freud's concept of femalecastration and penis envy. According to Freud, when children realise that some people (women) do not have a penis, this is a traumatic moment which produces different effectsin the boy and in the girl (see CASTRATION COMPLEX). Whereas the boy develops afear of having his penis cut off, the girl envies the boy his possession of the penis, whichshe sees as a highly desirable organ. The girl blames the mother for depriving her of apenis, and redirects her affections to the father in the hope that he will provide her with achild as a symbolic substitute for the penis she lacks (Freud, 1924d).

‌‌‌‌　　Privation, then, refers to the female's lack of a penis, which is clearly a lack in thereal. However, by definition, the real is full'; the real is never lacking in itself, and thusthe notion of privation... Implies the symbolisation of the object in the real' (S4,218). Inother words, when the child perceives the penis (a real organ) as absent, it is only becausehe has a notion that it somehow should be there, which is to introduce the symbolic intothe real. Thus what is lacking is not the real organ, for, biologically speaking, the vaginais not incomplete without one; what is lacking is a symbolic object, the symbolic phallus. Its symbolic nature is confirmed by the fact that it can be substituted by a child in thegirl's unconscious; in appeasing her penis envy by desiring a child, Freud argues, the girl'slips-along the lines of a symbolic equation, one might say-from the penis to a baby (Freud, 1924d: SE XIX, 178-9).

‌‌‌‌　　Freud argues that the little girl blames her mother for depriving her of a penis. Lacan, however, argues that it is the imaginary father who is held to be the agent of privation. However, these two accounts are not necessarily incompatible. Even though the girl mayat first resent the mother for depriving her of a penis and turn to the father in the hopethat he will provide her with a symbolic substitute, she later tumns her resentment againstthe father when he fails to provide her with the desired child.

‌‌‌‌　　Freud argues that penis envy persists into adulthood, manifesting itself both in thedesire to enjoy the penis in sexual intercourse, and in the desire to have a child (since thefather has failed to provide her with a child, the woman turns to another man instead). Lacan argues that even when the woman has a child, this does not spell the end of hersense of privation. Her desire for the phallus remains unsatisfied, no matter how manychildren she has. The mother's basic dissatisfaction (S4,194) is perceived by the childfrom very early on; he realises that she has a desire that aims at something beyond herrelationship with him-the imaginary phallus. The child then seeks to fulfil her desire byidentifying with the imaginary phallus. In this way, the privation of the mother isresponsible for introducing the dialectic of desire in the child's life for the first time.
