‌‌‌‌　　在1951年，拉康开始在西尔维娅·巴塔耶位于里尔大街3号的公寓里举办私人讲座。这些讲座当时有一小批受训精神分析家来参加，并且是以阅读弗洛伊德的一些个案研究为基础的：杜拉、鼠人以及狼人。在1953年，这些讲座的地点迁到了圣安娜医院 (Hopital Sainte-Anne), 因为那里可以容纳更多的听众。尽管拉康有时候会把1951一1952年与1952一1953年的私人讲座称作他前两年的“研讨班”，但是该术语现在则通常被保留给于1953年开始的公开讲座。从那时起，一直到拉康在1981年逝世，他在每一学年都会采用一个不同的主题并就其发表一系列的演讲。这27年的系列讲座往往以单数的形式被共同地称作“研讨班”。

‌‌‌‌　　在圣安娜医院举办十年之后，研讨班在1964年迁至高等师范学校 (Ecole Normale Superieure),而在I973年又搬到法学院 (Faculte de Droit)。这些地点的变更是出于种种原因，而不仅仅是因为研讨班在20世纪五六十年代的巴黎知识分子复苏中渐渐变成了一个焦点而出现的容纳不断增加的听众的需要。

‌‌‌‌　　鉴于拉康坚持强调言语是精神分析的唯一媒介 (E, 40), 适合让拉康发展并阐释其思想的原始手段或许就应当是口头语言。实际上，诚如一位评论家所评论的那样：“我们必须记得，拉康的《著作集》(Ec)原本几乎全部都是口头的发言，而且这种开放式的研讨班在很多方面也是他首选的工作环境。”(Macey, 1995:77)

‌‌‌‌　　随着拉康的研讨班变得越来越受欢迎，把研讨班转录为书面文本的需求也在与日俱增。然而，除了他在研讨班期间所举办的讲座的基础上写的几篇短文之外，拉康从未出版过他自己研讨班的任何记录。在1956一1959年，拉康曾授权让-伯特兰·彭塔力斯发表这几年研讨班讲座中个别章节的摘要，但是这并不足以满足人们日渐增加的对于拉康教学的书面记录的需求。因此，有关拉康研讨班的一些未经授权的文字记录便渐渐开始以一种几乎秘密的方式在拉康的追随者中间流传开来。在1973年，拉康允许他的女婿雅克-阿兰·米勒编辑并出版1964年所举办讲座的文字记录，即第11期研讨班。从那时起，米勒便继续出版了其他几年研讨班的编辑版本，尽管出版的数量仍旧不到一半。米勒在编辑并出版研讨班讲稿方面的角色，曾经导致了一些非常激烈的争论，因为反对者们宣称他歪曲了拉康的原作。然而，正如米勒自己所指出的，从口头到书面媒介的过渡，以及此种过渡所需要的编辑，皆意味着这些研讨班讲稿被发表出来的版本永远都不可能只是拉康讲座的简单文字记录 (见：Miller, 1985)。迄今为止，只有九个年度的研讨班讲稿以书籍的形式得到了出版，而其他年份的研讨班讲稿的授权摘录则出现在《奥尼卡？》(Ocar?)期刊中。那些无出版年份的研讨班的未经授权的文字记录，目前仍然继续在法国本土与海外流传。

‌‌‌‌　　每一年 (或每一“卷”)研讨班的标题皆被列在下面。原文的法语标题和出版细节则被列在这部辞典最后的参考文献当中。


‌‌‌‌　　(seminaire) In 1951, Lacan began to give private lectures in Sylvia Bataille's apartmentat 3 rue de Lille. The lectures were attended by a small group of trainee psychoanalysts, and were based on readings of some of Freud's case histories: Dora, the Rat Man and the Wolf Man. In 1953, the venue of these lectures moved to the Hopital Sainte-Anne, wherea larger audience could be accommodated. Although Lacan sometimes refers to theprivate lectures of 1951-2 and 1952-3 as the first two years of his 'seminar', the term isnow usually reserved for the public lectures which began in 1953. From that point onuntil his death in 1981, Lacan took a different theme each academic year and delivered aseries of lectures on it. These twenty-seven annual series of lectures are usually referredto collectively as'the seminar', in the singular.

‌‌‌‌　　After ten years at the Hopital Sainte-Anne, the seminar moved to the Ecole Normale Superieure in 1964, and to the Faculte de Droit in 1973. These changes of venue weredue to various reasons, not least of which was the need to accommodate the constantlygrowing audience as the seminar gradually became a focal point in the Parisianintellectual resurgence of the 1950s and 1960s.

‌‌‌‌　　Given Lacan's insistence that speech is the only medium of psychoanalysis (E, 40), itis perhaps appropriate that the original means by which Lacan developed and expoundedhis ideas should have been the spoken word. Indeed, as one commentator has remarked;'It must be recalled that virtually all of Lacan's "writings" (Ecrits) were originally oralpresentations, that in many ways the open-ended Seminar was his preferred environment' (Macey, 1995:77).

‌‌‌‌　　As Lacan's seminars became increasingly popular, demand grew for writtentranscripts of the seminar. However, apart from a few small articles that he wrote on thebasis of some lectures delivered in the course of the seminar, Lacan never published anyaccount of his own seminars. In 1956-9 Lacan authorised Jean-Bertrand Pontalis topublish a few summaries of sections of the seminar during those years, but this was notenough to satisfy the growing demand for written accounts of Lacan's teaching. Henceunauthorised transcripts of Lacan's seminar began increasingly to be circulated amonghis followers in an almost clandestine way. In 1973, Lacan allowed his son-in-law, Jacques-Alain Miller, to publish an edited transcript of the lectures given in 1964, theeleventh year of the seminar. Since then, Miller has continued to bring out edited versionsof other years of the seminar, although the number published is still fewer than half. Miller's role in editing and publishing the seminar has led to some very heatedarguments, with opponents claiming he has distorted Lacan's original. However, as Miller himself has pointed out, the transition from an oral to a written medium, and theediting required by this, means that these published versions of the seminar could neverbe simple transcripts of the lectures given by Lacan (see Miller, 1985). So far only nineof the yearly seminars have been published in book form, while authorised extracts fromothers have appeared in the journal Ornicar? Unauthorised transcripts of the unpublishedyears of the seminar continue to circulate today, both in France and abroad.

‌‌‌‌　　The titles of each year (or each 'book') of the seminar, are listed on p.177. Theoriginal French titles and publication details are listed in the bibliography at the end ofthis dictionary.
